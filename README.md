This is my first MERN (mongo, express, react, node) app.
It is not completely finished.

The idea of this app is to make a place where you can register and quote your developing skills, search for other developers and connect with them.

This is my code along project with [**John Smilga**](https://github.com/john-smilga) but I changed project theme and some technical stuff like using *Zod* authentication
